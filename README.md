# Flappy Bird Rust

This is a simple implementation of the Flappy Bird game in Rust using the `rusty_engine` library.

## Prerequisites

Before running the Flappy Bird game, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Rust (stable version)

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the project from the repository.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Build the project by running the following command:

   ```shell
   cargo build --release

4. Once the build is successful, locate the compiled executable file in the target/release directory.

5. Transfer the executable file to the target computer where you want to run the game.

6. On the target computer, make sure Rust is installed.

7. Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory where you transferred the executable file.

8. Run the Flappy Bird game by executing the following command:

   ```shell
   ./flappy_rust

## Controls

Spacebar: Jump (to avoid hitting the pipes)
R: Restart the game (when the game is lost)
